PyKafka Usage Guide
===================

This document contains prose explanations and examples of common patterns of PyKafka
usage.

Consumer Patterns
-----------------

Setting the initial offset
--------------------------

This section applies to both the `SimpleConsumer` and the `BalancedConsumer`.

When a PyKafka consumer starts fetching messages from a topic, its starting position in
the log is defined by two keyword arguments: `auto_offset_reset` and `reset_offset_on_start`.

.. sourcecode:: python

    consumer = topic.get_simple_consumer(
        consumer_group="mygroup",
        auto_offset_reset=OffsetType.EARLIEST,
        reset_offset_on_start=False
    )

The starting offset is also affected by whether or not the Kafka cluster holds any
previously committed offsets for each consumer group/topic/partition set. In this
document, a "new" group/topic/partition set is one for which Kafka does not hold any
previously committed offsets, and an "existing" set is one for which Kafka does.

The consumer's initial behavior can be summed up by these rules:

- For any *new* group/topic/partitions, message consumption will start from
  `auto_offset_reset`. This is true independent of the value of `reset_offset_on_start`.
- For any *existing* group/topic/partitions, assuming `reset_offset_on_start=False`,
  consumption will start from the offset
  immediately following the last committed offset (if the last committed offset was
  4, consumption starts at 5). If `reset_offset_on_start=True`, consumption starts from
  `auto_offset_reset`. If there is no committed offset, the group/topic/partition
  is considered *new*.

Put another way: if `reset_offset_on_start=True`, consumption will start from
`auto_offset_reset`. If it is `False`, where consumption starts is dependent on the
existence of committed offsets for the group/topic/partition in question.

Examples:

.. sourcecode:: python

    # assuming "mygroup" has no committed offsets

    # starts from the latest available offset
    consumer = topic.get_simple_consumer(
        consumer_group="mygroup",
        auto_offset_reset=OffsetType.LATEST
    )
    consumer.consume()
    consumer.commit_offsets()

    # starts from the last committed offset
    consumer_2 = topic.get_simple_consumer(
        consumer_group="mygroup"
    )

    # starts from the earliest available offset
    consumer_3 = topic.get_simple_consumer(
        consumer_group="mygroup",
        auto_offset_reset=OffsetType.EARLIEST,
        reset_offset_on_start=True
    )

This behavior is based on the `auto.offset.reset` section of the `Kafka documentation`_.
