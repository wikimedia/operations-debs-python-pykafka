python-pykafka (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream release of 1.1.1
  * Backport fix of auto_offset_reset=-1 bug: Issue #241
    auto_offset_reset=-1 with new consumers now does what is expected.
    This is a behavior breaking change, as pykafka now consumes from
    the latest offset for new consumers.  The default auto_offset_reset
    in later upstream has been changed to -2, in order to not change
    pykafka's behavoir.  This backport leaves the default at -1.
